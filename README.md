# Project: Website for a Recyclers Association in Macatuba, SP - Brazil

## Description:

This project was developed as a practical project for the "Projeto Integrador 3" course of the Computer Engineering, Information Technology and Data Science courses at UNIVESP - Virtual University of the State of SÃ£o Paulo.

## Purpose:

The purpose of this project is to create a website for a recyclers association in the city of Macatuba, State of SÃ£o Paulo - Brazil. The website will provide information about the association, its services, and how to get involved. It will also serve as a platform for the association to connect with the community and promote recycling awareness.

### Technologies:

_Back-end:_

_Django:_ A high-level Python web framework that facilitates rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. It takes care of much of the web development work, so you can focus on writing your application without having to reinvent the wheel. https://www.djangoproject.com/
Front-end:

_Soft UI:_ An open-source design system built with Bootstrap 5 and Soft Dashboard, a pixel-perfect design from Creative-Tim. It offers a modern and intuitive user experience, with over 300 individual elements, such as buttons, inputs, navigation bars, navigation tabs, cards, and alerts, giving you the freedom to pick and choose to create custom interfaces. https://github.com/app-generator/django-admin-soft-dashboard

## Data Visualization:

_Plotly:_ A JavaScript data visualization library for creating high-quality interactive charts and graphs. It offers a wide range of customization options and is compatible with multiple browsers and devices. https://plotly.com/python/

## Data Analysis:

_Pandas:_ A Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It offers a powerful and easy-to-use data structure for working with tabular data and time series. https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/

## Quick start

## Codebase structure

The project is coded using a simple and intuitive structure presented below:

```bash
< PROJECT ROOT >
   |
   |-- core/
   |    |-- settings.py                  # Project Configuration
   |    |-- urls.py                      # Project Routing
   |
   |-- home/
   |    |-- views.py                     # APP Views
   |    |-- urls.py                      # APP Routing
   |    |-- models.py                    # APP Models
   |    |-- tests.py                     # Tests
   |    |-- templates/                   # Theme Customisation
   |         |-- includes                #
   |              |-- custom-footer.py   # Custom Footer
   |
   |-- requirements.txt                  # Project Dependencies
   |
   |-- env.sample                        # ENV Configuration (default values)
   |-- manage.py                         # Start the app - Django default start script
   |
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

<br />

## How to Customize

When a template file is loaded in the controller, `Django` scans all template directories starting from the ones defined by the user, and returns the first match or an error in case the template is not found.
The theme used to style this starter provides the following files:

```bash
< LIBRARY_ROOT >                      # This exists in ENV: LIB/admin_soft
   |
   |-- templates/                     # Root Templates Folder
   |    |
   |    |-- accounts/
   |    |    |-- login.html           # Sign IN Page
   |    |    |-- register.html        # Sign UP Page
   |    |
   |    |-- includes/
   |    |    |-- footer.html          # Footer component
   |    |    |-- sidebar.html         # Sidebar component
   |    |    |-- navigation.html      # Navigation Bar
   |    |    |-- scripts.html         # Scripts Component
   |    |
   |    |-- layouts/
   |    |    |-- base.html            # Masterpage
   |    |    |-- base-fullscreen.html # Masterpage for Auth Pages
   |    |
   |    |-- pages/
   |         |-- index.html           # Dashboard page
   |         |-- profile.html         # Settings  Page
   |         |-- *.html               # All other pages
   |
   |-- ************************************************************************
```

When the project requires customization, we need to copy the original file that needs an update (from the virtual environment) and place it in the template folder using the same path.

> For instance, if we want to **customize the footer.html** these are the steps:

- âœ… `Step 1`: create the `templates` DIRECTORY inside the `home` app
- âœ… `Step 2`: configure the project to use this new template directory
  - `core/settings.py` TEMPLATES section
- âœ… `Step 3`: copy the `footer.html` from the original location (inside your ENV) and save it to the `home/templates` DIR
  - Source PATH: `<YOUR_ENV>/LIB/admin_soft/includes/footer.html`
  - Destination PATH: `<PROJECT_ROOT>home/templates/includes/footer.html`

> To speed up all these steps, the **codebase is already configured** (`Steps 1, and 2`) and a `custom footer` can be found at this location:

`home/templates/includes/custom_footer.html`

By default, this file is unused because the `theme` expects `footer.html` (without the `custom_` prefix).

In order to use it, simply rename it to `footer.html`. Like this, the default version shipped in the library is ignored by Django.

In a similar way, all other files and components can be customized easily.

<br />
